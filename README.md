## Introduction

**Pocketainer** is a mobile and desktop-friendly application designed to let you access and manage Docker deployments, without needing to rely on the official Portainer web dashboard. Whether you're a developer, sysadmin, or tech enthusiast, Pocketainer puts container control directly in your hands.

---

## Why Pocketainer?

- üåê **Remote Access** for Portainer API
- üì± **Mobile and Desktop Optimized** UI for maximum usability
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Minimalist Design** focused on function over flash

The current implimentation of the Portainer Web Dashboard lacks a responsive UI for varying screen sizes and DPIs. Pocketainer was specifically designed with mobile and desktop platforms in mind. With Pocketainer, you don't have to struggle to manage your docker infrastructure on mobile or desktop.

## Design Philosophy

Pocketainer‚Äôs interface is deliberately **minimalist**. Every screen is curated to minimize complexity and maximize simplicity, all while preserving rich information and stats.

## Version Support
Pocketainer is currently compatible with Portainer Community Edition, 2.27.9 LTS.
Has not been tested with Business Edition.

## Alpha Roadmap

The app is currently in **alpha**. That means:
- Major features are still being built
- Roadmap is not final; Features may be moved to a different version release
- The UI/UX is subject to change
- Bugs and edge cases are expected

With that being said, I do plan to impliment the following functionalities for an overall MVP:
